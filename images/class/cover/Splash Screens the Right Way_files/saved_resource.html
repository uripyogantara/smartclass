This means that if you issue an asynchronous call may still be running meaning that startup may not be finished before your splash screen goes away.\n\nDepending on the task running in the background this could be no big deal or it could mean your UI is unresponsive after the splash screen goes away until the background task finished.","canVote":false,"thread":"4072960608","forum":"bignerdranch","depth":3,"points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>any solution for that???\u003c/p>","id":"2701708453","isHighlighted":false,"author":{"username":"disqus_fk05HAYgIC","about":"","name":"sarath chandra","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"url":"","isAnonymous":false,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/disqus_fk05HAYgIC/","isPowerContributor":false,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"signedUrl":"","isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2016-05-29T18:04:30","id":"209799892","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_fk05HAYgIC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1495487563/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_fk05HAYgIC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1495487563/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"https://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/disqus_fk05HAYgIC.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1495487563/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isSpam":false,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"createdAt":"2016-05-29T18:18:42","parent":2578564473,"isApproved":true,"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"raw_message":"any solution for that???","canVote":false,"thread":"4072960608","forum":"bignerdranch","depth":4,"points":0,"moderationLabels":[],"isEdited":false,"sb":false},{"dislikes":0,"numReports":0,"likes":0,"message":"\u003cp>If your app requires synchronous loading (as this article addresses) and asynchronous loading (like fetching data from the internet) before the user can use your app, you will need to show the user some kind of loading screen while you fetch that data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>I recommend using the technique in this article for the synchronous loading, but also giving your SplashActivity a layout file and only calling finish on your SplashActivity when everything is loaded.

<p>To be honest, I didn't put a lot of thought in to that attribute. The theme is already setting a windowBackground, so it'd be best to override that instead. I'll get it updated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Interesting. If I remember correctly, there was some issue with using background (I think it was related to the Android version). I agree that a full-screen splash would seem a little strange.</p>

<p>I'll also note that lack of scaling and certain devices like the Nexus 5 not showing this screen (due to app launch animation), I was forced to use an activity with an actual layout with an ImageView (using fitCenter scaling) and a Handler.postDelayed() transition to the next activity.</p><p>I then set android:windowBackground to the same color as the back of the splash (otherwise it'd briefly show the default dark Material background color).</p><p>Unfortunately, this method does result in a brief delay (again, not seen on the Nexus 5) before the logo is displayed but it at least scales to fit the screen.</p><p>I greatly appreciate this solution that you've come up with for unobtrusive splash screens that has zero impact on app load times.  I'm just required to have explicit branding displayed.</p>

<p>i absolutely like this approach. but you should specify in the article that the initialization have to start before the SplashScreenActivity.onCreate() (likely in the App.onCreate) AND it works only if it's a blocking operation.<br>If it's async, (EG: the expansion file download from the play store at the very first time) should be handled in a slightly different way<br>It's clear from the sources, and obvious for an experienced user, though.</p>

<p>There are two types of actions that can be taken, synchronous and asynchronous.  A synchronous task occurs on the same thread and you wait until it is finished.  An asynchronous task runs on a different thread and you continue after the call is made and run in parallel with the new task.  It is possible for the main thread to finish before the other thread does.  This means that if you issue an asynchronous call may still be running meaning that startup may not be finished before your splash screen goes away.</p><p>Depending on the task running in the background this could be no big deal or it could mean your UI is unresponsive after the splash screen goes away until the background task finished.</p>

<p>If your app requires synchronous loading (as this article addresses) and asynchronous loading (like fetching data from the internet) before the user can use your app, you will need to show the user some kind of loading screen while you fetch that data.</p><p>I recommend using the technique in this article for the synchronous loading, but also giving your SplashActivity a layout file and only calling finish on your SplashActivity when everything is loaded. You could also show some kind of progress indicator in the SplashActivity's layout file after the quick start technique from this article is complete.</p>

<p>In the xml file drawable/background_splash, change the value --&gt; android:gravity="center" to --&gt; android:gravity="fill"</p><p>This will stretch the image out to the corners. But the image will not look good and optimised for the screen, it will look badly stretched and have poor quality. So the best option is to keep the value "center", and edit the image to a higher resolution. Remember to have the splash screen image edited with the correct screen resolution of your mobile, you can change this by looking up the screen size of the mobile online. Most screens use the same ratio, so just upscale the image after editing the resolution to your mobile and the image will adjust.</p>

<p>I don't know of a way to supply a dimension size within an XML drawable. The size would typically be defined on the ImageView, Button, etc that you use this XML drawable with. In this case, you don't have a View to do that with since it's the background for the window.</p><p>There may be something in the XML documentation that helps satisfy your requirements: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fguide%2Ftopics%2Fresources%2Fdrawable-resource.html%3ABGuz73tGHa3zsIiPBTDTL7wpy6c&amp;cuid=2923514" rel="nofollow noopener">http://developer.android.co...</a>. Maybe the scale drawable?</p>

<p>Having this issue too. Splash seems to be cut off on the top and bottom. Would putting the image inside of an ImageView and assigning that to the Activity layout xml be counterproductive to what we are trying to accomplish here?</p><p>Thanks for the great article btw.</p>

<p>Yes, once you have a layout file, the splash screen technique I talk about here is no longer valid. When you are able to use your layout file, your app is ready for the user to use.</p><p>Are you trying to fill the screen with an image? I don't know if there's an easy way to make that happen (nicely) for any screen size and I can't think of any real-world examples that use this technique and a full screen image.</p><p>That said, XML drawables are surprisingly powerful and there's a lot that you can pull off with the various tags and nesting. Take a look at all of the features of XML drawables in the docs and see if you can mold it into something that solves your problem: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fguide%2Ftopics%2Fresources%2Fdrawable-resource.html%3ABGuz73tGHa3zsIiPBTDTL7wpy6c&amp;cuid=2923514" rel="nofollow noopener">http://developer.android.co...</a></p>

<p>As I said to GeN-1</p><p>In the xml file drawable/background_splash, change the value --&gt; android:gravity="center" to --&gt; android:gravity="fill"</p><p>This will stretch the image out to the corners. But the image will not look good and optimised for the screen, it will look badly stretched and have poor quality. So the best option is to keep the value "center", and edit the image to a higher resolution. Remember to have the splash screen image edited with the correct screen resolution of your mobile, you can change this by looking up the screen size of the mobile online. Most screens use the same ratio, so just upscale the image after editing the resolution to your mobile and the image will adjust. :)</p>

<p>Hi Chris Stewart,<br>This looks a very good way, and its really working to avoid blank screen while loading.</p><p>But when second Activity is starting very fast after Splash Activity(i.e. when its not a cold start), its looks like screen is flickering because it shows Splash for very short time say few mili seconds, and that does not look nice.<br>could you please help improve that ?</p>

<p>If your application does not have a long load time, I'd recommend simplifying your splash screen to make the flashing less jarring.</p><p>You could do something as simple as having your splash screen be a solid color (the same background color as your app). This will also give the impression that your app is loading slightly faster than it actually is.</p><p>Otherwise, the flashing that you're seeing is unavoidable. The Google apps that use the technique in this post have that same sort of flashing.</p><p>In the end, I'd just recommend simplifying your splash screen as much as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, animation is incompatible with the technique in this post. The goal of this technique is to be as fast as possible so that you get the user in to your app as soon as it's loaded. Once the animation is ready to play, the app is ready for the user to use it.</p><p>If you want to add an animation, you'll just do the same thing that you would do when you have an animation in a normal Activity. Give your splash screen activity a layout file, find views in that layout file, and call the animate method on those views.</p><p>Here's a tutorial on ViewPropertyAnimator, which is one of the more popular animation techniques: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fandroid-developers.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F05%2Fintroducing-viewpropertyanimator.html%3AlJ8zFMQaI4UryeuoiFpB4l3NKmc&amp;cuid=2923514" rel="nofollow noopener">http://android-developers.b...</a></p>

<p>Unless you have a resource qualifier (like drawable-port or values-port) on your background or theme, it should work in any orientation.</p><p>That said, I just tried it out on my device and I think I know what you're seeing. Since I used a phone to test this, the launcher is locked to portrait even though my phone is in landscape. So, when I open the app, Android immediately tries to rotate the screen to landscape.</p><p>During that switch, the automatic rotation animation kicks off. This rotation animation is just a screenshot of the current screen that is animated. But at this point, there's nothing in the app to take a screenshot of, so Android just shows a black screen during the rotation.</p><p>That's my guess at least. Definitely a strange behavior and I can't think of a way to get around that.</p>

<p>You're onto something with the launcher being locked to portrait.  If I set my launcher to auto-rotate then the splash works fine.  My work around for it is to add android:screenOrientation="portrait" to the splash screen activity entry in the manifest.  At least this way something shows up in portrait instead of a black screen.  On my phone with Nova launcher locked to portrait if I am holding landscape the splash will show up in portrait, then it actually rotates to landscape and then my main app screen appears.  Not perfect, but better than black screen.  I really appreciate help.</p>

<p>Did you by any chance find a workaround for this?<br>The splashscreen itself does work. You can test this by starting the app on a tablet you already have landscape mode. It's indeed the animation that throws a spanner in the works.</p>
